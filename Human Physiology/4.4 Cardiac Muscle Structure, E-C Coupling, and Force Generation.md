## Learning Objectives
- explain how [[cardiac muscle]] [[myofilament|myofilaments]] and contraction are regulation
- explain the contractle [[cardiac myocyte]] [[action potential]]
- explain the mechanism underlying the refractory period
- explain the absence of **tetanus** in the contractile [[cardiac myocyte]]

## Concepts
- [[cardiac muscle]] is involuntary, striated muscle
- coupling between the membrane [[action potential]] and contraction is mediated by \[Ca\] ions -> regulated [[actin]] to enable [[myosin#cross bridge cycling]]
- regulated by the autonomic nervous system
- [[action potential|action potentials]] are initiated by an influx of extracellular \[Na\]
- [[cardiac muscle]] contracts in unison (due to [[gap junctions]]) and does not develop **fused tetanus** due to [[cardiac muscle#refractory period]]
