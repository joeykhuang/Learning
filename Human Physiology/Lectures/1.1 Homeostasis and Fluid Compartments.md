## Learning Objectives
- Basic organization of the body
- [[fluid compartments]] of the body
- How solutes distribute in the body
- Explain [[homeostasis]]
- Explain [[mass balance]]

## Concepts
- human body is an interdependent set of **self-regulating** systems whose primary function is to maintain an internal environment compatible with **living cells and tissues** $\rightarrow$ [[homeostasis]]
- stability of internal variables is achieved by balancing **inputs** and **outputs** to the body and [[organ system]]
