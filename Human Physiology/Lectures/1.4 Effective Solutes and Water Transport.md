## Learning Objectives
- Explain [[osmosis]]
- Contrast [[osmolarity]] and [[tonicity]]
- Explain how effective solutes regular [[fluid compartments]] of the body

## Concepts
- [[intercellular fluid compartment|ICF]] and [[extracellular fluid compartment|ECF]] are in osmotic balance
- [[osmosis]]: [[facilitated diffusion]] across **aquaporin** across [[cell membrane]]
- cell volume is dependent on #steady_state of [[effective solutes]] and water across [[cell membrane]]
- cells shrink in [[hypotonic]] and swell in [[hypertonic]] conditions
