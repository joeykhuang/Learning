## Learning Objectives
- Describe how solutes cross [[cell membrane]]
- Contrast [[transporters]], [[pumps]], and [[channels]]
- Describe how [[ion channels]] are gated

## Concepts
- movement of a solute across [[cell membrane]] depends on its size, charge, and solubility
- net flux is determined by gradients
- a permeable solute crosses by [[simple diffusion]], and a non-permeable solute crosses by [[facilitated diffusion]] via [[transporters]]
- [[active transport#primary active transport]]: moves against concentration gradient and uses ATP
- [[active transport#secondary active transport]]: couples [[transporters#Co-transporters]] with a [[pumps]]: used for [[transcellular transport]]

### Importance of [[transporters]], [[pumps]], and [[channels]]
**Basis of physiological processes**
- growth
- metabolic activities
- sensory perception

**Basis of disease**
- defective [[transporters]]: [[cystic fibrosis]]
- defective [[channels]]: [[long QT syndrome]], [[paralysis]]

**Basis of pharmacological therapiess**
- [[hypertension]]: treated with [[diuretics]]
	- decrease volume of the [[extracellular fluid compartment|ECF]]
- [[stomach ulcers]]: treated with [[proton pump inhibitors]]

### [[simple diffusion]] \& [[gap junctions]]
net flux is determined by gradients: [high] $\Rightarrow$ [low]
[[gap junctions]] permits diffusion of ions between coupled cells
