## Learning Objectives
- contrast [[homeostatic control#reflexes]] and [[homeostatic control#local response]]
- characterize [[hormone#Classes]]
- explain the role of [[carrier proteins]]
- explain differences among [[hormone#Receptor Types]]
- explain differences in stimuli and regulation

## Concepts
- [[hormone#peptide protein hormones]] are soluble in [[plasma]], bind [[hormone#integrated membrane proteins]], fast-acting and short-lived
- [[hormone#steroid hormones]] and thyroid hormones ([[hormone#amino acid derivatives]]) are insoluble in [[plasma]], act via [[hormone#intracellular nuclear receptor]], slow-acting and long-lived
- [[carrier proteins|carriers]] regulate [[hormone]] availability, physiologic function, and #half_life 
- [[hormone]] release is under neural, hormonal, nutrient and ion regulation ([[endocrine system#Types of Stimulus]])
- signaling is regulated by [[plasma]] [[hormone]] concentration and target cell receptor sensitivity

- ### Concentration of [[hormone]] in blood
**rate of production:** most regulated aspect & mediated by [[feedbacks]]
**rate of delivery:** dependent on [[perfusion]] and [[blood flow]], follows mass action laws ([[carrier proteins|carriers]]): $H \cdot C \rightleftharpoons H + C \rightleftharpoons H \cdot R$
