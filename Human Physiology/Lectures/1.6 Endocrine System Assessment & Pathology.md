## Learning Objectives
- explain principles and limitations of hormone measurements (RIA, ELISA) and [[bioassays]]
- eplain classification of [[endocrine system#Pathologies]]

## Concepts
- pathology occurs when there is either too little or too much [[hormone]] or resistance to hormone due to receptor dysfunction
- interpretation of [[hormone]] levels requires consideration of either the trophic hormones or of the ion/nutrient controled by the [[hormone]]

## Sections
- [[#Assessment of Function]]
- [[#Competitive Binding Assay]] vs [[#Bioassay]]
- [[endocrine system#Pathologies]]

### Assessment of Function
- **too much**: hypersecretion, [[hormone]] excess
- **too little**: hyposecretion, [[hormone]] insufficiency
- **target cell resistance**: unresponsive
	- [[diabetes#Type 2]]
- **just right**: eusecretion

### Competitive Binding Assay
- uses a specific [[antibody]] + labeled [[hormone]]
- unlabeled hormone (from patient body) competes with labeled hormone
- high sensitivity and high specificity
- does not tell us whether the [[hormone]] is active
- does not work in cases like [[diabetes#Type 1]]

### Bioassay
- ![[Pasted image 20210526133456.png|200]]
- **suppression test**: gives [[Dexamethasone]] to inhibit [[ACTH]] and [[cortisol]] release in [[H-P-Adrenal axis]]
- **stimulation test**: gives [[ACTH]] to stimulate [[cortisol]] release in [[H-P-Adrenal axis]]
