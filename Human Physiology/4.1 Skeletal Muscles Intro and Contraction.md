## Concepts
- all [[muscle]] are composed of [[actin]] and [[myosin]]
- relative sliding of [[actin]] and [[myosin]] involves [[myosin#cross bridge cycling]] -> uses [[ATP]]
- \[Ca\] ions couple membrane [[action potential|action potentials]] and contraction
- [[skeletal muscle]] has an [[actin]]-based control system, and relaxation occurs with the removal of \[Ca\]
