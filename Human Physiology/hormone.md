## Classes
### peptide/protein hormones
- **preprohormone**: inactive species
	- 3 amino acids or bigger
	- synethesized on the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]
	- can be further cleaved as it's delivered to the [[golgi apparatus|golgi]]
- **prohormone**: inactive species
	- cleaved in the [[golgi apparatus|golgi]]
	- turns into the active hormone
- example: [[insulin]]
	- C peptide is cleaved off

### steroid hormones
- made by the [[adrenal glands]], [[gonads]], and [[placenta]]
- are not soluble in blood (has to be carried by [[carrier proteins]])
- synthesized and secreted on demand (takes more time to increase in amount)
- can be converted by the target tissue
- examples: [[pregnenolone]], [[testosterone]] (converted to DHT or estrogen)

### amino acid derivatives
- example: [[epinephrine]]
	- soluble in [[plasma]] and short #half_life 
	- derivative of [[tyrosine]]
- example: [[thyroxine]]
	- insoluble in [[plasma]] and long #half_life 
	- conversion in target tissues (T4 $\to$ T3)
	- derivative of [[tyrosine]]

## Receptor Types
### [[integrated membrane proteins]]
- [[tyrosine]] Kinase-linked: growth hormone
- Inherent [[tyrosine]]: [[insulin]]
- G protein coupled: [[glucogon]]
	- activates cascade
### intracellular/nuclear receptor: 
- changing the activity of the [[DNA]]
- [[#peptide protein hormones]] and [[#steroid hormones]]
