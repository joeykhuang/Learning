## Concepts
- the [[membrane potential#equilibrium potential]] of an ion is when the chemical gradient and electrical gradient are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction
- \[Na\]/\[K\] [[ATPase]] re-equilibrates the [[membrane potential#resting membrane potential]]
- [[graded potentials]] are electrical signals that are local and vary with the intensity of the stimulus and have no refractory period
