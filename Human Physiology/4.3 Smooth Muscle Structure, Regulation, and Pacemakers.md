## Learning Objectivess
1. describe the structure and function of [[smooth muscle]]
2. explain how [[myofilament]] are regulated
3. three ways how contraction is initiated
4. explain spontaneous electrical activity ([[pacemaker]])
5. contrast single- and multi-unit [[smooth muscle]]

## Concepts
- [[smooth muscle]] is an invountary, non-striated [[muscle]] associated with [[blood vessels]] and visceral [[organ|organs]]
- contains overlapping protein [[myofilament|myofilaments]]: [[actin]] & [[myosin]]
- coupling between membrane [[action potential]] and contraction is mediated by \[Ca\]
- in [[pacemaker]] cells, [[action potential|action potentials]] are initiated by an influx of extracellular \[Ca\]
- some smooth muscle exhibits **fused tetanus** and **tonic contraction**
