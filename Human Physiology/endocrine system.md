## Types of Stimulus
### neural control
- neuroendocrine cell senses concentration of \[Na\] in the blood
- secretes [[ADH]]
- [[ADH]] goes to the kidney and dilutes the \[Na\] in the blood
- secretes from the [[brain#posterior pituitary]]
### hormonal control
- a series of [[hormone]] controls
- a complex [[feedbacks#Negative feedback]] loop
- secretes from the [[brain#anterior pituitary]]
### substrate control
- low \[Ca\] levels activates the [[parathyroid]]
- secretes [[PTH]], which lets bone to secrete \[Ca\]
- secretes from the [[pancreas#pancreatic islet]]

### Inactivation of [[hormone]] signaling
- receptor desensitization:
	- sequestration
	- degredation
- [[feedbacks#Negative feedback]]: removes initial stimulus
