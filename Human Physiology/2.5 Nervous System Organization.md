## Concepts
- the [[nervous system#central nervous system]] and [[nervous system#peripheral nervous system]] constitute a reflex arc: CNS integrates sensory input and provides appropriate output
- efferent portion of the [[nervous system#peripheral nervous system]] is divided into somatic and autonomic nervous systems
- sympathetic and parasympathetic act reciprocally and in opposition
- enteric division acts independently in the gut but can be modulated
