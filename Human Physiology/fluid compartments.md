### Components
- [[intercellular fluid compartment|ICF]]
- [[extracellular fluid compartment|ECF]]
	
[[ATPase]]: pumps every 3 \[Na\] for 2 \[K\]

#equilibrium between [[interstitial fluid space|IS]] and [[intervascular compartment|IV]]
#steady_state between [[extracellular fluid compartment]] and [[intercellular fluid compartment]]

### Changes in fluid compartments
| condition | total body water | ECF volume | ICF volume | effect on ECF Osmolarity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IV [[isotonic]] saline | increase | increase | no change | no change |
| diarrhea ([[isotonic]] loss) | decrease | decrease | no change | no change |
| excessive [[NaCl]] intake |  no change | increase | decrease | increase |
| excessive sweating ([[hypotonic]] loss) | decrease | decrease | decrease | increase |
