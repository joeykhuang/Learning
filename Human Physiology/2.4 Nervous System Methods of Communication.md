## Concepts
- [[neurons]] process incoming information by symming the post-synaptic [[membrane potential]] charges ([[graded potentials|graded potential]])
- **spatial summation** is the addition of inputs occurring within neighboring synapses / **temporal summation** is the addition of inputs occurring very close to one another in time
- [[neurotransmitter]] transmit signals within milliseconds by binding to receptors
