## Concepts
- an [[action potential]] is a wave of depolarization followed by a wave of repolarization
- [[action potential]] are electric signals that propagate without decrement along axons, have refractory periods, and uni-directional

### voltage gated \[Na\] and \[K\] [[channels]]
depolarization of the [[cell membrane]] is the stimulus which leads to both [[ion channels]] to open

\[Na\] channel is fast, and \[K\] channel is slow

reset the \[Na\] [[channels]] from inactive to closed $\rightarrow$ repolarize the [[cell membrane]]

**refractory period**: \[Na\] [[channels]] are deactivated, cannot have [[action potential]] during this period
