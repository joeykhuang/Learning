## Concepts
- [[muscle sensory receptors]] detect and regulate muscle length and velocity
- [[muscle reflexes]] are initiated when sensory information is sent from muscle, tendon, or skin receptors to the [[spinal cord]] causing movement in the appropriate muscles
- [[central pattern generators]]: repetitive in nature, interneurons in the [[spinal cord]] coordinate muscle relaxation and contraction
