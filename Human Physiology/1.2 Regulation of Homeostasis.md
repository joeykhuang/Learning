## Learning Objectives
- Contrast reflex and local [[homeostatic control]]
- Define components of [[reflex loop]]
- Explain negative and positive [[feedbacks]]
- Explain [[tonic control]] and [[antagonistic control]]
- Explain [[circadian rhythms]]

## Concepts
- in negative feedback loops, a change to a variable is corrected by bringing the body back to the [[set point]], which can be reset
- not always possible to maintain everything relatively constant -- hierarchy of importance
