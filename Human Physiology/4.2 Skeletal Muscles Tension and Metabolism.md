## Concepts
- [[muscle]] can shorten at a constant force or develop force without shortening
- maximal [[skeletal muscle#velocity of shortening]] occurs with zero load, and speed of contractions is set by the [[myosin]] [[ATPase]]
- muscles with high requirements for [[ATP]] and resistance to [[skeletal muscle#fatigue]] have predominantly [[aerobic metabolism]]
