## Concepts
- [[somatic nervous system]] controls locomotion, fine movements, body posture, and equilibrium by acting on motor neurons in the [[spinal cord]]
- motor neurons have cell bodies in grey matter of the ventral horn of the [[spinal cord]]
- interneurons in the [[spinal cord]] coordinates the responses of antagonistic and synergistic muscles to carry out intended movements and reflexive movements
