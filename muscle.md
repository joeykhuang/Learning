[[cardiac muscle]]

## shared principles
- **sliding filament mechanism**: [[myosin]] filaments bind to and move [[actin]] filaments -> basis for shortening
	- ![[Pasted image 20210610225621.png|400]]
- [[myosin]] and [[actin]] are regulated by \[Ca\] ions
	- \[Ca\] binds to [[troponin]] which causes [[tropomyosin]] to move out of the way
	- exposes [[actin]] to [[myosin]] heads
- changes in the [[membrane potential]] lead to contraction (**E-C Coupling**)
