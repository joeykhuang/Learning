**Z-lines** determine the border

[[actin]] are thin filaments that cross the **Z-line**, and [[myosin]] are thick filaments walk towards the **Z-lines** ([[titin]] anchors [[myosin]] to the sarcomere)

**A band**: anywhere where muscle is dark and we have [[myosin]]
**I band**: anywhere where muscle is light and we only have [[actin]]
