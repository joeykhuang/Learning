### muscle spindle neuron
afferent neuron coiled around the muscle spindle senses *stretch* -> acts in *reciprocal innervation* -> [[feedbacks#Negative feedback]]

reciprocal innervation causes contraction of stretched muscle and relaxation of the antogonistic muscle (e.g: biceps & triceps)

### Golgi tendon neuron
[[golgi tendon organ]] -> encapsulated afferent nerve endings at the junction of muscle and tendon

activated by maximal *contraction* (tension) of the muscle, not passive stretch -> act in [[feedbacks#Negative feedback]]
