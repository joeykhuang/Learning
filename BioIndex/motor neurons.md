## types of lower motor neurons
**alpha motor neurons**: innervate extrafusal muscle fibers -> generate force for posture / movement
**gamma motor neurons**: innervate intrafusal muscle fibers -> monitors length of the muscle as it shortens (connects to afferent sensory neurons)

when the extrafusal fibers shorten -> intrafusal fibers shorten as well -> *parallel system*

alpha & gamma motor neurons are efferent fibers
