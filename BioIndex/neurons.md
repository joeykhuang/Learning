neurons can have very different morphologies

most important part: cell body
a single *a*xon: takes information *a*way from the cell body
can branch into different terminals

## electrochemical gradient
-  \[K\]-\[Na\] gradient that allows ions flows to occur
-  [[ATPase]] makes sure that there are much more \[Na\] than \[K\] outside the cell
-  when at rest, neurons have a **negative** [[membrane potential]]

## integration of signals
- **input**: dendrite & cell body (soma)
	- dendrite and dendrite body are going to have [[graded potentials]]
	- in the cell body, [[graded potentials]]
	- dendrites and cell body sum the [[graded potentials]] and determine if we have an [[action potential]] or not
- **output**: axon & axon initial segment
	- if [[membrane potential]] goes above **threshold** at the axon initial segment, we will have a [[action potential]]
	
### saltatory conduction
- myelinated axons transmit [[action potential]] very rapidly $\rightarrow$ does not leak \[Na\], only felt at the **Nodes of Ranvier**
- [[channels#voltage ion channels]] are concentrated at the nodes
- ensures uni-directional propagation along the axon
