[[spinal cord]] centered circuits -> coordiantes complex patterns of movement independent of sensory input and adjusted in response to sensory feedback

oscillatory & flexible (control of brain)

### locomotion
forward flexion (swing phase) of limb & backward extension (stance phase) that is repeatedd

*reciprocal innervation* of limbs
