aliases: [action potentials]

## process

### stage 1
at rest

### stage 2
some stimuli causes \[Na\] [[channels]] to open
if stimuli does not reach the **threshold**, it's a sub-threshold stimuli
if reaches the **threshold**, an action potential is going to happen no matter what (*all or nothing*)

### stage 3
big **repolarization** of the [[cell membrane]]


### stage 4
\[Na\] start to close, but \[K\] did not close yet, **hyperpolarization**

### stage 5
\[K\] finally closes, goes back to the [[membrane potential#resting membrane potential]]

## characteristics
actions potentials move one-way along the axon because of the absolute refractory period of the voltage-gated \[Na\] channel

we can only start a new action potential down-stream (upstream [[channels]] are in the **refractory period**)
