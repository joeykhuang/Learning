large, multinucleated cells
in the [[somatic nervous system]]

each muscle fiber has many [[myofibril|myofibrils]] -> number of these [[myofibril|myofibrils]] determine the **force generating capability** of the fiber

## stimulus frequency & tension
**AP duration**: 5 msec
**Twitch duration**: 100 msec
with a single [[action potential]], the tension is not maximal (twitch)

when we have frequent [[action potential|action potentials]], we reach a state called **tetanus** -> highest tension

## velocity of shortening
speed of shortening is related to the amount of **load**

**isotonic shortening**: tension > load (we have more tension than load, so we can shorten muscles)
**isometric contraction**: tension = load (just heavy enough that we can hold it but not shorten muscles)
**lengthening contraction**: load > tension (muscles are getting longer even though we are shortening it)

tension is also related to [[sarcomere]] length -> [[sarcomere]] should be stretched enough that there's still room for contraction but not overstretched so that [[myosin]] heads can contact [[actin]]

## metabolism
[[creatine phosphate]] donates a [[phosphate]] to convert [[ADP]] to [[ATP]] in the first seconds of muscle activity -> lasts 8 - 10 seconds

[[anaerobic metabolism]] pathways convert [[glucose]] and [[glycogen]] to [[lactic acid]] & [[ATP]] -> lasts 1.5 mins

[[aerobic metabolism]] pathways convert blood [[glucose]] and [[fatty acid]] to [[ATP]]

|                          | moles of [[ATP]] / min | time      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------- |
| [[creatine phosphate]]   | 4                      | 8-10 sec  |
| [[anaerobic metabolism]] | 2.5                    | 1.5 min   |
| [[aerobic metabolism]]   | 1                      | unlimited |


## fatigue
contributing factors for fatigue:
1. buildup of [[extracellular fluid compartment|ECF]] \[K\] -> persistent depolarization
2. buildup of metabolites which impair \[Ca\] [[ATPase]] and [[troponin]]-[[tropomyosin]]
3. buildup of Pi in [[intercellular fluid compartment|ICF]] inhibits [[myosin#cross bridge cycling]] -> leads to reduced ability for [[muscle]] cell to contract
4. decrease in fuel stores

## motor units
most skeletal muscles include all three [[muscle#fiber types]]
each **motor unit** has one type of muscle fiber:
- **small motor unit** has fewer fibers -> finer movement
- **large motor unit** has more fibers -> more tension

**slow-oxidative** muscles are recruited first, then **fast-oxidative-glycolytic**, and lastly **fast-glycolytic**
