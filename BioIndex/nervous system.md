## cell types
[[neurons]]
[[glial cells]]

## peripheral nervous system
- has **efferent** portion and **afferent** portion
- has [[glial cells#Schwann cells]]: one cell myelinates a portion of the axon

### input
**sensory systems**: 
- vision
- hearing
- taste
- equilibrium
- olfaction
- somatosensation
	- touch
	- pain
	- temperature
	- **proprioception**: where your body is in space

**automatic system**:
- enteric
- parasympathetic
- sympathetic
	- ==flight or fright==
[[somatic nervous system]]: skeletal muscles

### output
- [[somatic nervous system|somatic]]: releases [[acetylcholine]], which binds to nicotinic AChR on another [[neuron]] which causes a reaction in the [[skeletal muscle]]
- **parasympathetic**: releases [[acetylcholine]], bind nicotinic AChR on another [[neurons|neuron]], which releases [[acetylcholine]] that bind to muscarinic AChR
- **sympathetic**: releases [[acetylcholine]], bind nicotinic AChR, releases [[norepinephrine]] that bind to adrenergic receptors
- **adrenal**: releases [[acetylcholine]], bind nicotinic AChR, releases [[epinephrine]] into the blood

## central nervous system
- has [[glial cells#oligodendrocytes]]: one cell myelinates many different axons
- **astrocytes**: support neurons
- **microglial cells**: immune cells
