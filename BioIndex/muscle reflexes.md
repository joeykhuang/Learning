## muscle stretch reflex 

**when a muscle contracts** -> higher frequency of [[action potential|action potentials]]

**when a muscle relaxes** -> reduces frequency of [[action potential|action potentials]] via opening of $Cl^{2+}$ [[ion channels]]

### example: knee jerk reflex
strikes the **patella tendon** under the kneecap -> tugs on the **quadricep muscle** -> activates the [[muscle sensory receptors#muscle spindle neuron]] -> causes contraction of the **quadricep muscle** and relaxation of the **hamstring muscle** (antagonistic muscle) <- controled by the inhibitory interneuron in the [[spinal cord]]

### example: pouring of water
when glass gets heavier -> muscle contracts to keep arm level

## golgi tendon reflex
signal from the [[muscle sensory receptors#Golgi tendon neuron]] -> comes into the [[spinal cord]] -> acts on an excitatory neuron, causes contraction of the tricep & inhibitory neuron causes relaxation of the bicep

acts with *reciprocal innvervation*

## withdrawal reflex
reflex circuitry mediates withdrawal of limb from painful sensory reflex

**crossed extensor reflex**: provides postural support during withdrawal (extends other leg during withdrawal of leg)
