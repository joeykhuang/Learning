## equilibrium potential
- if concentration of [K] and [Na] are the same in and out of the cell, there is a 0 $mV$ potentail
- [[ion channels]] specific for [K] and are gated
- more [K] leaves the cell than enters the cell, eventually reaching equilibrium
- $E_K = -90 mV$, $E_{Na} = 60mV$
	- cell potentials if only \[K\] [[channels]] or \[Na\] [[channels]] are open
	
## resting membrane potential
- \[Na\]/\[K\] [[ATPase]] establishes chemical concentration gradient
- pumps more \[Na\] out (2[K] in for 3[Na] out)
- resting membrane potential is negative

## changes in membrane potential
- at rest, a cell is **polarized**
- if membrane potential comes closer to $0$, we call it **depolarization**
- above $0$, it's called **overshoot**
- when it drops back down to [[#resting membrane potential]], it is **repolarizing**
- if the membrane potential becomes more negative, it's called **overpolarization**
