[[integrated membrane proteins]] that has a pore

## gating
### [[ligand]]
- requires binding of specific *chemical* to open
- [[acetylcholine]] binds to nicotonic receptor on the [[skeletal muscle]]
### voltage [[ion channels]]
- requires a specific gradient of *electricial charge* across the membrane to open
- **voltage-gated calcium channel**
### mechanical
- requires specific *tension* to open
- smooth muscle in the [[cardiovascular system]] ([[tonic control]])

## Example

**aquaporin**: a pore that moves water across the [[cell membrane]]

solutes move by diffusion from [high] $\Rightarrow$ [low]
