small, single nucleated cells

no [[t-tubule]] and no [[troponin]]-[[tropomyosin]]

contraction is regulated by [[myosin]] filaments ([[myofibril]])
[[actin]] is anchored to the [[plasma membrane]] by [[dense body|dense bodies]] (analagous to **Z-lines**)

cell becomes more of a square shape when shortened

## \[Ca\] regulation

increase of intracellular \[Ca\] activates [[myosin light chain kinase]]

[[myosin light chain kinase|MLC kinase]] phosphorylates [[myosin]], activating [[myosin#cross bridge cycling]]

[[myosin#cross bridge cycling]] leads to shortening and tension

## contraction

### types of contraction
slow [[myosin]] [[ATPase]] = slow contraction
**tonic**: tension generated is proportional to the stimulus, sustained over time (found in [[muscle]] that surrounds [[blood vessels]]) (exhibited by **multi-unit**)
**phasic**: single contraction followed by relaxation = **twitch** 

### regulation of contraction
net input to the cells govern whether the cells are going to relax or contract
- [[channels#mechanical]]
	- stretching the walls of the muscle -> allows \[Ca\] into the cell
	- occurs in [[blood vessels]], higher amount of blood stretches cell walls, \[Ca\] comes into the cell, and muscle contracts
- [[channels#ligand]]
	- modulated by the [[autonomic nervous system]] -> controlled by [[norepinephrine]]
		- can bind to $\alpha_1$ [[adrenergic synapses]] on [[blood vessels]] (contracts when active) or $\beta_2$ [[adrenergic synapses]] on the [[bronchae]] of the [[lung]] (relaxes when active)
	- [[hormone]]: [[oxytoxin]] causes smooth muscle of the [[uterus]] to relax
	- **paracrine agentss**: \[K\] or \[H\] dilates [[blood vessels]]
- [[channels#voltage ion channels]]
	- spontaneous [[pacemaker]] potentials

## single- & multi-unit fibers
**single-unit**: a few cells are innervated, [[gap junctions]] spread the [[membrane potential]] of neigherboring cells -> **synchronous activity** (found in the [[gastrointestinal track]], [[uterus]], small [[blood vessels]])

**multi-unit**: each fiber is innervated, few or no [[gap junctions]], and not activated by **stretch receptors** (associated with hair follicles)
