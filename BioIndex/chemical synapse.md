main idea: two cells come very close together

[[action potential]] cause \[Ca\] [[channels#voltage ion channels]], which releases [[neurotransmitter]] into the **synaptic cleft**

very, very rapid -- large amounts of [[neurotransmitter]]

**postsynaptic cell**: the downstream cell
if downstream cell is a [[neurons|neuron]], causes a  [[graded potentials|graded potential]]

### excitatory postsynaptic potential
a graded depolarization due to influx of positive ions

### inhibitory postsynaptic potential
a graded hyperpolarization due to net influx of negative ions or net efflux of positive ions

## types
