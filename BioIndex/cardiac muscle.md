rather large (25 micrometers in diameter), central nuclei

connected by specialized [[gap junctions]] -> electrical coupling

adhesion placks for mechanical coupling, called **intercalated disk**

**striated**: contains [[sarcomere|sarcomeres]]

## excitation-contraction coupling
(parallels [[skeletal muscle]])

[[cardiac myocyte]] is thick enough that diffusion is not sufficient to bring \[Ca\] into the cell, instead brings electrical activity down [[t-tubule]] -> cause release of intracellular \[Ca\] in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]

[[action potential]] comes down [[t-tubule]] open a [[channels#voltage ion channels]] ([[dihydropyridine channel]]), opens the [[ryanodine channel]] on the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] -> \[Ca\] is released and engages with [[myofilament|myofilaments]], and acts on [[actin]] through the [[troponin]]-[[tropomyosin]] complex

### ways of removing \[Ca\]
1. when muscle relaxes, \[Ca\] [[ATPase]] (also called **SERCA**) removes \[Ca\] and stored in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (how it occurs in [[skeletal muscle]])
2. a sodium-calcium exchanger exchanges \[Ca\] with \[Na\]
3. a \[Ca\] [[ATPase]] pumps \[Ca\] actively outside the cell

## contractile cells
### fast [[action potential]]

very fast **depolarization** (phase 0)

very low **resting** [[membrane potential]]: -85 mV

reaches a plateau (phase 2): opens \[Ca\] channels and \[K\] channels -> causes isoelectric phase (rather long ~200 ms & unique to [[cardiac myocyte]])

very fast **repolarization**

### refractory period
![[Pasted image 20210617150901.png|200]]
no **tetanus** because inactivation of \[Na\] [[channels]] (200 ms) almost equals the duration of the contraction

**absolute refractoy period**: 0 - 180 ms
**relative refractory period**: 180 - 200 ms (can be opened if there is a stimulus)

## fiber length & tension
stronger contraction with increased filling of [[heart]] -> **Frank Starling law of the Heart**

resting condition is not optimal for tension

contracts with [[skeletal muscle]]: resting condition is optimal
