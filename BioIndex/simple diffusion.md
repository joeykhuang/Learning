molecules move from a [high] $\Rightarrow$ [low]
requires no energy expenditure
continues until #equilibrium 
rapid over short distances and slow over long distances
directly related to #temperature
inversely related to the size of the molecule (larger molecules are slow)
dependent on the surface area & thickness of the [[cell membrane]]
