thick filament, makes up the **I-bands**

## cross bridge cycling

rigor state: no [[ATP]] bound & tightly bound to [[actin]] -> cause of [[rigor mortis]]

[[ATP]] bound: myosin lets go of [[actin]]

[[ATP]] hydrolysis: myosin head ratchets forward, and release of $Pi$ causes **power stroke**

release of [[ADP]]: returns the myosin to the rigor state
