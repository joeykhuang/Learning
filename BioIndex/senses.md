### somatosensation
receptors in skin, muscle, bones, and visceral receptors
- **touch and pressure**: mechanoreceptors in encapsulated and free nerve endings (close to the surface of the skin)
- **proprioception**: muscle stretch receptors, mechanoreceptors in skin, joints, tendons, ligaments, vision, vestibular system
- **temperature**: thermoreceptors ([[ion channels]] activated at certain temperatures) & menthol, capsaicin, ethanol
- **pain**: free nerve endings expressing nociceptors, sense mechanical deformation, and chemicals released by damaged cells or immune cells

### special senses
receptors confined to a specific [[organ]] and are associated with cranial nerves
- vision
- hearing
- vestibular system
- chemical senses: taste & smell

also includes visceral stimuli

### principles
**sensation**: sensory information that reaches the brain
**perception**: how we interpret the sensation
**adaptation**: decrease in sensitivity, decreased [[action potential]] frequency w/ same stimulus
