sound waves are transmitted through air by the compression and expansion of air molecules in the form of pressure waves

complex sounds are broken down into their basic sound frequencies

sound frequencies are converted into [[action potential]] by the [[ear]] and relayed to the [[brain]]

## sound transduction
after a hair cell activates the afferent neuron, axons join to form the cochlear nerve

the region of the basilar membrane that vibrates the most correlates with the frequency of [[action potential|action potentials]]
