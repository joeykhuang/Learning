converts energy from the photon into an electrical signal

**step 1:** binds to retinal (based on [[vitamin]] A) from photopigment changes conformation when exposed to ligh
**steps 2-5:** causes a decrese in cGMP, closes cGMP-gated cation channel, photoreceptor cell is depolarized at rest, and the closing of the [[ion channels]] causes a [[graded potentials|graded potential]] where the cell become hyperpolarized

photoreceptors and bipolar cells generate [[graded potentials]]
[[ganglion]] generate [[action potential]]

6 [[rods]] -> 2 bipolar cells -> 1 [[ganglion]]
